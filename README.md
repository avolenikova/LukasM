*Resources for our project:)*

**TO DO LIST:**
- [x] Dowload Ppho reads from Darwin Tree of Life
- [x] Convert .cram to .fastq.gz
- [x] Check data using FastQC
- [x] Learn how the data look like - especially the read structure (where are technical sequences?)
- [x] Research Trimmomatic and think about how the reads should be trimmed/filtered 
- [x] Run Trimmomatic and pre-process the reads
- [x] Check the filtered and trimmed reads w/ FastQC
- [ ] Literature review (topics: Pholcus, spider cytogenetics, telomeres... more topics will appear during reading;); also, what is the genome size in closely related spiders?)
- [ ] Read pre-processing for REx2
- [ ] download data from more species
- [ ] read conversion, quality control, trimming+filtering, quality control
- [ ] comparative analysis RepeatExplorer (all species)


Notes from our last meeting (02/09/2021):
- availability of DToL Pholcus data? => DToL gives permissions to use the data upon email request
- can we make Pholcus (and other spiders) preparations? Petr said we can :)
- conference talk on spiders? => not available yet, I will keep checking and send you links ASAP
- REx2 manual (step by step)? => everything is described in detail here: https://rdcu.be/b80Gr (this will be our REx2 bible :) )
- sample script REx2 data preprocessing? => uploaded to the "scripts" folder, will need module update and adjustments for our analysis
